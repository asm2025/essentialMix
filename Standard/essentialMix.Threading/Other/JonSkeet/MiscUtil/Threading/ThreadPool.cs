	/// Each instance runs with entirely separate threads, so one thread pool
	/// cannot "starve" another one of threads, although having lots of threads
	/// running may mean that some threads are starved of processor time.
	/// If the values for properties such as MinThreads, IdlePeriod etc are changed

	/// are noticed. For instance, reducing the idle time from 5 minutes to 1 minute
	/// will not prevent a thread which had only just started to idle from waiting
	/// for 5 minutes before dying. Any exceptions thrown in the work item itself
	/// are handled by the WorkerException event, but all other exceptions are
	/// propagated to the AppDomain's UnhandledException event. This includes
	/// exceptions thrown by the BeforeWorkItem and AfterWorkItem events.
