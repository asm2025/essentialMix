	/// <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A*</see> is special case of best-first
	/// search that solves for single pair shortest path using heuristics to try to speed up the search. It is
	/// often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness. One major practical drawback is
	/// its O(b^d) space complexity. it is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph
	/// to attain better performance as well as memory-bounded approaches; however, A* is still the best solution
	/// in many cases.

	/// robot and autonomous vehicle navigation. It finds a shortest path from its current coordinates to the goal
	/// coordinates under the assumption that it contains no obstacles. The robot then follows the path. When it
	/// observes new map information (such as previously unknown obstacles), it adds the information to its map and,
	/// if necessary, re-plans a new shortest path from its current coordinates to the given goal coordinates. It
	/// repeats the process until it reaches the goal coordinates or determines that the goal coordinates cannot be
	/// reached.
