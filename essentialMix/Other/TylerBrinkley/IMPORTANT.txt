The work in this folder is based on Enums.NET source which I cloned a long time ago.
I needed the functionality but I had to modify the source in a lot of places and make
some radical changes. After some years, in v3.0 Changes, I see TylerBrinkley made similar 
changes to deprecate of the NonGenericEnums, NonGenericFlagEnums, UnsafeEnums, and UnsafeFlagEnums :)
However, it is of valuable help for the majority of code that I used to make the EnumHelper.
